I participated in the [CRA-WP Grad Cohort](https://web.cvent.com/event/35faeffe-dbe1-4ea4-933c-57669f3d4c8a/summary) workshop, in which I learned some tips on grad school (publishing work, building confidence, finding a research topic, communication skills, etc.) from some amazing women in CS, including Kathi Fisler, Pamela Gibbs, Meredith Ringel Morris, Melanie Wu, Amanda Stent, and many others.
