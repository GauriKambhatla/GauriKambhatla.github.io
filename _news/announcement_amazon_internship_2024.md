I had a great summer in Seattle working at Amazon AWS on the Responsible AI team! I had an amazing mentor, Alicia Sagae, and manager, [Vanessa Murdock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessamurdock/). I also had the incredible opportunity to work with [Nil-Jana Akpinar](https://nakpinar.github.io/), [Sandeep Avula](https://asandeepc.bitbucket.io/), and [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/).
