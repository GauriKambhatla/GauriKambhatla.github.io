Here are some of my (rough) notes and takeaways from the conference; videos of the keynotes and paper presentations are available on YouTube if interested!</p> <hr> <h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3> <ul> <li>A lot of discussion of limitations &amp; criticisms of work in AI, particularly in regards to excluding or not taking into account certain demographic groups, or multiple axes of demographic groups (intersectionality)</li> <li>A lot of discussion around open questions – due to the inherent nature of the key ideas discussed here, like “fairness” and “accountability” and how we take these into account with our models/systems</li> <li>Many potential solutions to these open questions as well – mostly revolving around these big ideas: <ul> <li>Involve people of different demographic groups, and take into account intersectionality during all steps of system development (creating data, creating the model, evaluation, etc.)</li> <li>Make data better → data curation (rather than blindly scraping from the web without knowing what’s in it), data documentation, data transparency</li> <li>We need to take appropriate measures (such as regulation) to account for the consequences of LLMs right now – there are important issues at hand before getting to something like AGI</li> <li>We need to value more than just simple metrics like “performance” and “efficiency” when developing models, and should consider broader, societal implications <ul> <li>although I can see where having this be a requirement causes researchers to talk about societal implications very loosely – I don’t think every paper will necessarily have fundamental societal implications, though this seems very important for the ones that do; e.g., facial recognition systems</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>As a side note, I really appreciated the diversity in identity – such as gender, ethnicity, nationality – at the conference, as well as the diversity in work – the <em>interdisciplinary</em> nature – of the conference. It was fun to talk and learn from people in such different fields with so many different ideas!</li> </ul> <h3 id="keynotes">Keynotes</h3> <p><strong>Meeyoung Cha: News Media Landscape</strong></p> <ul> <li>Engagement metrics used by companies (e.g., time spent on a post) leads to the propagation of fake news + misinformation <ul> <li>People will spend more time on news that is odd/extreme → this will cause it/similar things to show up more</li> </ul> </li> <li>Misinformation propagates faster than true information <ul> <li>Starts with low-degree users, picked up by higher-degree users</li> <li>There exists a golden time to stop misinformation &amp; it must be flagged repeatedly (even if it is flagged once, it can still propagate as true in multiple other branches)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Poorer countries are at a higher risk of hearing rumors/misinformation</li> <li>Popular is not the same as believable; popular misinformation spreads a lot, but might not be believable (e.g., something is just really funny, but no one actually believes it) <ul> <li>We should focus on preventing rumors that are believable, not popular</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fact checks have been shown to no longer be useful once people actually believe the rumors</li> <li>Infodemic Risk Index: how likely someone is to be exposed to misinformation</li> <li>(Johnson et al, 2020): pro-vax vs. anti-vax facebook groups <ul> <li>Pro-vax groups tend to only talk amongst themselves, while anti-vaxxers try to reach out to other groups and get more people to join</li> <li>By 2033 → more groups will be connected to anti-vax groups</li> </ul> </li> <li>People’s emotions before + after covid: didn’t change much <ul> <li>Positive people tended to stay positive, negative people tended to stay negative</li> </ul> </li> <li>People with traumatic experiences prefer to talk with virtual agents than real ones → more anonymity</li> <li>Showing people fact-checks after they hear a rumor is more memorable (because they have been corrected, they remember it better) <ul> <li>But this is more high-risk → rumor has been heard, potential actions/consequences could already be taken</li> </ul> </li> <li>Who is responsible for handling misinformation? <ul> <li>Lay-people asked this question for creation + dissemination of misinformation <ul> <li>Put the most blame on users (but not themselves, i.e., “other” users)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Joint-accountability: users, news, social media, politicians</li> </ul> </li> <li>Handling misinformation + preserving democracy → in e.g., more religious countries, works better if religious figure discuss misinformation</li> </ul> <p><strong>Keynote Panel: Intersectionality + Algorithmic Fairness</strong></p> <ul> <li>Kimberly Crenshaw: intersectionality as a road intersection (where it came from)</li> <li>Not just about identity, but also about power dynamics <ul> <li>Language, nationality, sexual orientation, race, etc.</li> <li>Need to pay attention to all axes to define the human experience</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Fairness gerrymandering” → if we just take into account one (or a few) axes, we don’t account for everything</li> <li>Simplification of intersectionality: how much is okay? <ul> <li>There are many levels of simplification, does it help in getting to a better one?</li> <li>How do we align metrics + functions with human complexity?</li> <li>We shouldn’t become complacent: if a metric/task “works”, we need to continue to add to it, not just optimize it as is (common in ML)</li> </ul> </li> <li>How to identify all the axes of intersectionality? <ul> <li>Define a place to start/certain groups to start with and go from there (E.g., black youth interacting with tech assistants/chatbots) <ul> <li>They don’t care about things like the weather → chatbots have limited info on Black historical figures, things relevant to Black community members</li> <li>Limited ability to deal with language + dialect</li> <li>When asked, black youth reimagined chat bot as more of a life coach → esp important to lower class individuals</li> <li>“Class” emerges as an axis we care about for intersectionality</li> </ul> </li> <li>If we try to focus on all attributes → infinite regress <ul> <li>If we try to stop somewhere, then we have to choose which axes (this is either arbitrary or biased)</li> <li>Instead of trying to figure out which axes, we should focus on how to make changes in the operationalization of intersectionality</li> <li>E.g., reframe the purpose of algorithms (for example, mass incarceration of people of color)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>We’re not even close to the point of taking into account that an individual’s identity is not constant, but changes over time, changes with the context, the people you are with, etc.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Pascale Fung: Value-based NLP</strong></p> <ul> <li>Assigning human values with NLP/AI → problem is human values are: <ul> <li>Culturally-dependent (e.g., chivalry vs. sexism)</li> <li>Multi-perspective (e.g., trolley problem)</li> <li>Context-dependent (e.g., epithets in AAVE vs SAE)</li> <li>Multi-dimensional (e.g., sexism → body shaming, role/attribute stereotyping, pay gap, hyper-sexualization, internalized sexism, hostile work environment, …)</li> <li>[Parikh et al., 2019]</li> </ul> </li> <li>Align LLMs with human values? <ul> <li>LLMs are uncontrollable, not transparent, unstable (as of right now)</li> <li>Could try: filtering harmful content, debiasing models/embeddings, controlled generation, post-processing the output → these don’t work very well</li> <li>Proposal: encapsulate LLMs + embeddings <ul> <li>Design smaller models for downstream tasks, and get the training data by prompting LLMs</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Ethical questions <ul> <li>Match the ethical quandary to ethical principles (retrieve from datasets, or eastern/western philosophy)</li> <li>Match principles to automatic (generated) answers</li> </ul> </li> <li>Framing bias (Lee et al., NAACL 2022 → NEUS) <ul> <li>Neutral summarization</li> <li>Can we get NLP systems (e.g. QA) to take into account multiple perspectives</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar: The Rise of Hypersocial AI</strong></p> <ul> <li>Example: Lemoine ←→ Lamda conversation</li> <li>Machines are taking on pivotal roles in human life <ul> <li>Law, policy, diplomacy fields are not ready for this</li> </ul> </li> <li>Humans seek social interactions <ul> <li>But we desire them on our own terms</li> <li>We make decisions based on these/emotional things rather than rational choices (might not lead to the best decisions)</li> <li>This leads to both good and bad things</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tech affects human behavior</li> <li>Hypersocial AI: AIs that increasingly satisfy the human desire for social communication (rather than basic chatbots) <ul> <li>High interest + demand for characteristics of hypersocial AI</li> <li>Increasingly provide physical + mental health services, legal services, etc. → to reduce cost + human effort <ul> <li>As a result of isolation + loneliness + alienation (which has been increasing a lot since 1950)</li> <li>Even caring for plants has been shown to help mitigate the effects of isolation</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Young + socially-challenged: first to try to develop/seek social relationships (doctor, lawyer, educator, etc.) with hypersocial AI <ul> <li>Whether AI is actually able to “feel”/”think” is irrelevant to the increase in demand</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hypersocial AI can be beneficial in these situations (medical, legal, education, preventing social isolation, etc.), but also problems: <ul> <li>Policy-makers will be making decisions based on these</li> <li>Geo-economic competition for them</li> <li>Can exacerbate cultural conflict</li> <li>Can cause issues with authoritarian regimes</li> <li>People can + will rely on AI systems for decisions</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hypersocial AI will affect what we value <ul> <li>Analogous to the industrial revolution, food revolution → to provide for people at a larger scale, but there are pros/cons</li> </ul> </li> <li>None of these dilemmas are relevant to AGI (irrelevant to that debate) <ul> <li>Humans have bonds with pets, creatures, plants, etc. that don’t have AGI</li> </ul> </li> <li>We need legal systems + diplomacy to deal with hypersocial AI</li> <li>The Lemoine/Lamda interview is more important for what it says about Lemoine + humans than what it says about the model</li> <li>Governments will move intensely to have AI for e.g., medical purposes (because more cost-effective) until there is public push-back <ul> <li>This will likely affect disadvantaged people more</li> <li>But this is not necessarily bad, make AI more nuanced</li> </ul> </li> <li>Does hypersocial AI normalize contested notions of “social” and “the human” (e.g. for neuro-divergent individuals)? <ul> <li>Might actually do the opposite → could be able to be more flexible to different users</li> <li>Problem is who is in control of such systems</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="craft-session-hyperscale-lms--fairness-accountability-transparency">CRAFT session: Hyperscale LMs + fairness, accountability, transparency</h3> <ul> <li>LMs are sophisticated, but very clueless</li> <li>LMs are biased (e.g., GPT-3 + “Muslim walked into a mosque…”, Lee Luda chatbot + toxic generation)</li> <li>Bias in LLMs comes from annotators, data, models (Hovy + Prabhumoye, 2021 → 5 sources of bias in NLP)</li> <li>Technologists vs. ethicists: <ul> <li>Need both when developing technology, but two different methods of thinking, hard to reconcile</li> <li>Technologists: want a single metric, ethicists: don’t understand LMs</li> <li>Organizations (esp small start-ups) don’t have the ability to have both of these</li> </ul> </li> <li>Hard to define hate speech + toxic language <ul> <li>Context-dependent</li> <li>Mitigation strategies should be done together (don’t want to help one user group, but harm another – e.g., trying to reduce toxic speech, but biased against AAVE)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Kyunghyun Cho: on explaining how LMs work</strong></p> <ul> <li>Claude Shannon (1950) → entropy + language</li> <li>Cross entropy is upper bound to entropy → allows for high probability to rarely seen examples → allows for generalization</li> <li>Neural networks compress similar inputs</li> <li>Compressor is imperfect → allows for generalization</li> <li>Questions to consider: what information do LMs lose?
